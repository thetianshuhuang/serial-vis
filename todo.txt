- add cleaner event support
- add beginning settings support
- unify keyboard commands and command line
- priority value for each setting
- multi-device support:
	- each device has a threaded_serial instance
	- each device has its own settings instance
	- graphics in the main thread runs for each serial device
	- connected devices are given a name (stored in dict)
	- connect command:
		connect <filepath> <alias>
		disconnect <alias>
- more diverse draw functions:
	- rectangle
	- triangle
	- filled in option?
	- thickness specifier in all functions?
- save/load buffer to file:
	- save <buffer range> <filename> <flag>
- add support for direct byte sending:
	Plan for bin transmission:

	|| 0xFF [begin_transmission] || opcode || arg_size | ---arg--- || ... || 0x00 | ---string--- | 0x00 || check_size | check || 0xFF [EOT] ||
	Argument sizes are logarithmic:
	0x01 = uint8_t, byte,
	0x02 = uint16_t,
	0x03 = uint32_t, float,
	0x04 = uint64_t, double, 
	0x05 = uint128_t, quadruple (!), 

	Reserved arg_size characters:
	0x00 = string / null
	0xFE = begin/end tuple
	0xFF = Start / EOT
