- add beginning settings support
- add verification

Plan for bin transmission:

|| 0xFF [begin_transmission] || opcode || arg_size | ---arg--- || ... || 0x00 | ---string--- | 0x00 || check_size | check || 0xFF [EOT] ||
Argument sizes are logarithmic:
0x01 = uint8_t, byte,
0x02 = uint16_t,
0x03 = uint32_t, float,
0x04 = uint64_t, double, 
0x05 = uint128_t, quadruple (!), 

Reserved arg_size characters:
0x00 = string / null
0xFE = begin/end tuple
0xFF = Start / EOT
